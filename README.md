# Text Editor Starter Code

## Setup

- Run `npm install`
- For developing the CLIENT use `npm run client:dev`.  For developing the SERVER use `npm run server`.
- Ideally we would use `npm run start:dev` to support proxy or static serving.
- For production build the client with `npm run build` and run the production server using `npm run start`
